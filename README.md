This project implements the core program for Localization, Control, Mapping of a self driving car using Total probability, particle filters, Markov localization, Bayes Theory

The goal of Localization in this context is to equip our self driving car with the skill of localizing itself, or identifying where it is with a 10cm error tolerance as compared to traditional GPS sattelite technology which has anywhere up to 10m error range. This will obviously cause our self driving car to crash and is not acceptable.
